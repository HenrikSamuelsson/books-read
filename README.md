![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes stores. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers. The book advocates storing information about  the customers to be able to chitchat and bond with them. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children, pets, and interests since people seem to like to talk about this.

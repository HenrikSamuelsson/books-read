## Hug Your Customers : Love the Results 
By: Jack Mitchell  
ISBN: 9780141015224  
![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes stores. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers.  

The book advocates storing information about  the customers to be able to chitchat and bond with them. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children, pets, and interests since people seem to like to talk about this.  

## The Toyota Way  
By: Jeffery K. Liker  
ISBN(English version): 9780071392310  
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789147089024  
![Image of the book The Toyota Way](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/the_toyota_way.png?raw=true)  
Book about product manufacturing/development. Describes how Toyota thinks and work on achieving quality cars with few defects. Very useful book when planning to start or trying to improve production.  

## Latex in 157 Minutes  
By: Tobias Oetiker  
ISBN: 9789881443625  
![Image of the book Latex in 157 Minutes](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/latex_in_157_minutes.png?raw=true)  
Teaches the typesetting system Latex that can be used to produce great looking text documents. Latex is like Microsoft Word but for smart productive people.

Maybe not the best book I have read but I did learn some nice tricks and tips that are useful when using Latex.  

## Programming in C  
By: Stephen G. Kochan  
ISBN: 9780321776419  
![Image of the book Programming in C](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/programming_in_c_4th.png?raw=true)  
Solid book for beginners that want to learn C programming. The writing is extremely clear and concise.

This was a reread for me but picked up some news details that I missed during the previous read. For example how to make a typedef to a function pointer with the purpose of improving code readability.  

## How to be a Productivity Ninja  
By: Graham Allcott  
ISBN: 9781785780288  
![Image of the book How to be a Productivity Ninja](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/productivity_ninja.png?raw=true)   
This is a book from the "become a better person" shelf so is not strictly a fact or science book. This means that it is hard to verify and value the information in the book.

The book promises to make you a more productive person and it is probably true that most people would be more productive if they would follow the advice from this book.  

The book is fairly fast to read and it is inexpensive. You will hence probably get your time back pretty fast by becoming more productive and maybe even your money if your boss or customers notices your improvements.  

## Milling a Complete Course  
By: Harold Hall  
ISBN: 9781854862327  
![Image of the book Milling a Complete Course](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/milling_a_complete_course.png?raw=true)  
Introduction to the milling machine. Drawings and instructions for a series of projects that gives experience in milling.  

Working with metal is very much not my field expertise but it would be nice to be more handy. There was a lot of stuff that I did not really understand in this book but also gained some knowledge. Will try to read some more and watch some videos to become confident enough to try an actual mill.  

## SÃ¥ Funkar Allt (Thing Explainer)  
By: Randall Munroe  
ISBN(English version): 9781473620919  
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789187419980  
![Image of the book Thing Explainer](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/sa_funkar_allt.png?raw=true)  
Funny book that explains how various things work, written by the maker of [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/). All explanations are written using just the very most common words. Loads of drawings to explore in addition to the text.  

Warning! Don't buy a e-book version, go for physical copy of this book, because the book itself is large and there are big foldouts that wont work well on a small screen.  

## Head First Java, 2nd Edition  
By: Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates   
ISBN: 9780596009205  
![Image of the book Head First Java](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/head_first_java.png?raw=true)  
Great introduction to the Java programming language. Probably not the best book for absolute beginners in programming, and parts of the book are dated by now, but other than that an excellent read if starting out to learn Java.

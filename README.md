![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes store. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers. The book advocates storing information about customers to be able to chitchat and bond with their customers. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children since people seem to like to talk about this.

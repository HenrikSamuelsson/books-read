## Hug Your Customers : Love the Results 
By: Jack Mitchell  
ISBN: 9780141015224  
![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes stores. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers.  

The book advocates storing information about  the customers to be able to chitchat and bond with them. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children, pets, and interests since people seem to like to talk about this.

## Latex in 157 Minutes

![Image of the book Latex in 157 Minutes](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/latex_in_157_minutes.png?raw=true)  
Teaches the typesetting system Latex that can be used to produce great looking text documents. Latex is like Microsoft Word but for smart productive people.

Maybe not the best book I have read but I did learn some nice tricks and tips that are useful when using Latex.  

## Programming in C  
By: Stephen G. Kochan  
ISBN: 9780321776419
![Image of the book Programming in C](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/programming_in_c_4th.png?raw=true)  
 
Solid book for beginners that want to learn C programming. The writing is extremely clear and concise.

This was a reread for me but picked up some news details that I missed during the previous read. For example how to make a typedef to a function pointer with the purpose of improving code readability.

## Hug Your Customers : Love the Results 
By: Jack Mitchell  
ISBN: 9780141015224  
![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes stores. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers.  

The book advocates storing information about  the customers to be able to chitchat and bond with them. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children, pets, and interests since people seem to like to talk about this.  

## The Toyota Way

Book about product manufacturing/development. Describes how Toyota thinks and work on achieving quality cars with few defects. Very useful book when planning to start or trying to improve production.  

## Latex in 157 Minutes  
By: Tobias Oetiker  
ISBN: 9789881443625  
![Image of the book Latex in 157 Minutes](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/latex_in_157_minutes.png?raw=true)  
Teaches the typesetting system Latex that can be used to produce great looking text documents. Latex is like Microsoft Word but for smart productive people.

Maybe not the best book I have read but I did learn some nice tricks and tips that are useful when using Latex.  

## Programming in C  
By: Stephen G. Kochan  
ISBN: 9780321776419  
![Image of the book Programming in C](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/programming_in_c_4th.png?raw=true)  
Solid book for beginners that want to learn C programming. The writing is extremely clear and concise.

This was a reread for me but picked up some news details that I missed during the previous read. For example how to make a typedef to a function pointer with the purpose of improving code readability.  

## How to be a Productivity Ninja  
By: Graham Allcott  
ISBN: 9781785780288  
![Image of the book How to be a Productivity Ninja](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/productivity_ninja.png?raw=true)   
This is a book from the "become a better person" shelf so is not strictly a fact or science book. This means that it is hard to verify and value the information in the book.

The book promises to make you a more productive person and it is probably true that most people would be more productive if they would follow the advice from this book.  

The book is fairly fast to read and it is inexpensive. You will hence probably get your time back pretty fast by becoming more productive and maybe even your money if your boss or customers notices your improvements.  

## Milling a Complete Course  
By: Harold Hall  
ISBN: 9781854862327  
![Image of the book Milling a Complete Course](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/milling_a_complete_course.png?raw=true)  
Introduction to the milling machine. Drawings and instructions for a series of projects that gives experience in milling.  

Working with metal is very much not my field expertise but it would be nice to be more handy. There was a lot of stuff that I did not really understand in this book but also gained some knowledge. Will try to read some more and watch some videos to become confident enough to try an actual mill.  

## Så Funkar Allt (Thing Explainer)  
By: Randall Munroe  
ISBN(English version): 9781473620919  
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789187419980  
![Image of the book Thing Explainer](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/sa_funkar_allt.png?raw=true)  
Funny book that explains how various things work, written by the maker of [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/). All explanations are written using just the very most common words. Loads of drawings to explore in addition to the text.  

Warning! Don't buy a e-book version, go for physical copy of this book, because the book itself is large and there are big foldouts that wont work well on a small screen.  

## Head First Java, 2nd Edition  
By: Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates   
ISBN: 9780596009205  
![Image of the book Head First Java](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/head_first_java.png?raw=true)  
Great introduction to the Java programming language. Probably not the best book for absolute beginners in programming, and parts of the book are dated by now, but other than that an excellent read if starting out to learn Java.   

## A Brief History of Time

ISBN: 9780857501004

The journey of a jazz band from the start, struggling to get a gig at small clubs, to the end when they were famous enough to fill prestigious concert halls.  

Proves that the ingredients to success is a bit of talent combined with hard work and dedication.

![Image of the book The Grand Design](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/the_grand_design.png?raw=true)  
About the creation and the fate of the universe as trying to be explained by physicists. The book explains the topics fairly well and there are nice color picture even in the pocket version. The reader is in the end unfortunately left hanging because the scientists does not really seem to have solved the riddle yet.  

## Head First Design Patterns  
By: Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates  
ISBN: 9780596007126  
![Image of the book Head First Design Patterns](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/head_first_design_patterns.png?raw=true)  
Very nice introduction to design patterns, that serves as a great warm-up before reading the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.  

Note that all examples are written in Java so it is necessary to be some what knowledgeable in this programming language to fully appreciate the book.  

## TCP/IP Foundations  
By: Andrew G. Blank  
ISBN: 9780782143709  
![Image of the book TCP/IP Foundations](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/tcp_ip_foundations.png?raw=true)  
Easy to read book for beginners who is interested in learning the basics of TCP/IP. The questions at the end of each chapter highlight the main points and offer a good review of each chapter.

Note that this version of the book is a bit old and focused on setting up Windows systems. This means that parts of the book are outdated with descriptions of how to setup older Windows versions that are now retired.  

## Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies  
By: Nick Bostrom  
ISBN: 9780198739838  
![Image of the book Superintelligence](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/superintelligence.png?raw=true)  
Philosophical book about what could happen when we create an artificial intelligence that is superior to humans intelligence. The author reasons that this could be dangerous and we might need to take precautions.  

## Agile Project Management with Scrum  
By: Ken Schwaber

![Image of the book Agile Project Management with Scrum](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/agile_project_management_with_scrum.png?raw=true)  
Scrum is a project management methodology for complex project such as team software development. The book serves as a fast and easy read for getting introduced to Scrum.  

I personally liked the check list about the scrum rules in appendix A. It summarized the methodology very well.  

## Make: Bluetooth  
By: Alasdair Allan, Don Coleman & Sandeep Mistry  
ISBN: 9781457187094  
![Image of the book Make Bluetooth](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/make_bluetooth.png?raw=true)  
Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) by showing how to build various projects based on popular maker hardware like for example Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Does not provide deep knowledge on BLE, but the book is adequate for anyone that looks for a quick introduction.  

Note that quite a bit of hardware is needed to finish all the projects, this will cost way more than the book itself.  

Lacks explanations for running the projects on Windows machines so look elsewhere if this is your preferred development environment.  

## Mine-Craft  
By: Daniel Goldberg, Linus Larsson  
ISBN: 9789113070247  
![Image of the book Mine-Craft](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/minecraft.png?raw=true)  
Nice book about development of the game Minecraft and the man behind the game i.e. Markus "Notch" Persson.   

This book is written in Swedish, I am not aware of an English version.  

## Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

ISBN: 9780735611313  
![Image of the book Code](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/code.png?raw=true)  
Partly explanation of how computers work and partly computer history. The explanations of how computers work are done extremely thoroughly starting out with the very basics and then builds on until a complete computer have been introduced.  

This book is old by now, since it was released in year 2000, but it is still a formidable book well worth reading.

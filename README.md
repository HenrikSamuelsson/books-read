# Reading 2016
List of books that I have read during 2016. My goal is to read or 52 books during 2016, i.e. one average one book every week.  

## Hug Your Customers : Love the Results 
By: Jack Mitchell  
ISBN: 9780141015224  
![Image of the book Hug Your Customers](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/hug_your_customers.png?raw=true)  
Business book about how a man runs his clothes stores. I read this book to become better at handling my customers. Since I have very little contacts with the end-users of my work so are my customers mainly my bosses and my coworkers.  

The book advocates storing information about  the customers to be able to chitchat and bond with them. Shall build my own data base holding information about my customers children, pets, and interests since people seem to like to talk about this.  

## The Toyota Way  
By: Jeffery K. Liker  
ISBN(English version): 9780071392310  
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789147089024  
![Image of the book The Toyota Way](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/the_toyota_way.png?raw=true)  
Book about product manufacturing/development. Describes how Toyota thinks and work on achieving quality cars with few defects. Very useful book when planning to start or trying to improve production.  

## Latex in 157 Minutes  
By: Tobias Oetiker  
ISBN: 9789881443625  
![Image of the book Latex in 157 Minutes](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/latex_in_157_minutes.png?raw=true)  
Teaches the typesetting system Latex that can be used to produce great looking text documents. Latex is like Microsoft Word but for smart productive people.

Maybe not the best book I have read but I did learn some nice tricks and tips that are useful when using Latex.  

## Programming in C  
By: Stephen G. Kochan  
ISBN: 9780321776419  
![Image of the book Programming in C](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/programming_in_c_4th.png?raw=true)  
Solid book for beginners that want to learn C programming. The writing is extremely clear and concise.

This was a reread for me but picked up some news details that I missed during the previous read. For example how to make a typedef to a function pointer with the purpose of improving code readability.  

## How to be a Productivity Ninja  
By: Graham Allcott  
ISBN: 9781785780288  
![Image of the book How to be a Productivity Ninja](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/productivity_ninja.png?raw=true)   
This is a book from the "become a better person" shelf so is not strictly a fact or science book. This means that it is hard to verify and value the information in the book.

The book promises to make you a more productive person and it is probably true that most people would be more productive if they would follow the advice from this book.  

The book is fairly fast to read and it is inexpensive. You will hence probably get your time back pretty fast by becoming more productive and maybe even your money if your boss or customers notices your improvements.  

## Milling a Complete Course  
By: Harold Hall  
ISBN: 9781854862327  
![Image of the book Milling a Complete Course](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/milling_a_complete_course.png?raw=true)  
Introduction to the milling machine. Drawings and instructions for a series of projects that gives experience in milling.  

Working with metal is very much not my field expertise but it would be nice to be more handy. There was a lot of stuff that I did not really understand in this book but also gained some knowledge. Will try to read some more and watch some videos to become confident enough to try an actual mill.  

## Så Funkar Allt (Thing Explainer)  
By: Randall Munroe  
ISBN(English version): 9781473620919  
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789187419980  
![Image of the book Thing Explainer](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/sa_funkar_allt.png?raw=true)  
Funny book that explains how various things work, written by the maker of [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/). All explanations are written using just the very most common words. Loads of drawings to explore in addition to the text.  

Warning! Don't buy a e-book version, go for physical copy of this book, because the book itself is large and there are big foldouts that wont work well on a small screen.  

## Head First Java, 2nd Edition  
By: Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates   
ISBN: 9780596009205  
![Image of the book Head First Java](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/head_first_java.png?raw=true)  
Great introduction to the Java programming language. Probably not the best book for absolute beginners in programming, and parts of the book are dated by now, but other than that an excellent read if starting out to learn Java.   

## A Brief History of Time  
By: Stephen Hawking  
ISBN: 9780857501004  
![Image of the book A Brief History of Time](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/a_brief_history_of_time.png?raw=true)  
About how physicists try to understand out how the universe works. The book lives at the popular science shelf in the book store so anyone can read it. Very interesting and a highly recommended read.  

## Life at the Speed of Light
By: J. Craig Venter  
ISBN: 978349139906  
![Image of the book Life at the Speed of Light](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/life_at_the_speed_of_light.png?raw=true)  
Biological genetics research on how to possibly construct new types of bacteria, animals and even humans by starting out with a computer aided draft that then can be artificially grown into that what we call a real life form.  

## A Strange Tale  
By: Hans Olov Öberg  
ISBN: 9789185535828  
![Image of the book A strange tale](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/a_strange_tale.png?raw=true)  
The journey of a jazz band from the start, struggling to get a gig at small clubs, to the end when they were famous enough to fill prestigious concert halls.  

Proves that the ingredients to success is a bit of talent combined with hard work and dedication.  

## The Grand Design  
By: Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow  
ISBN: 9788129119711  
![Image of the book The Grand Design](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/the_grand_design.png?raw=true)  
About the creation and the fate of the universe as trying to be explained by physicists. The book explains the topics fairly well and there are nice color picture even in the pocket version. The reader is in the end unfortunately left hanging because the scientists does not really seem to have solved the riddle yet.  

## Head First Design Patterns  
By: Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates  
ISBN: 9780596007126  
![Image of the book Head First Design Patterns](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/head_first_design_patterns.png?raw=true)  
Very nice introduction to design patterns, that serves as a great warm-up before reading the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.  

Note that all examples are written in Java so it is necessary to be some what knowledgeable in this programming language to fully appreciate the book.  

## TCP/IP Foundations  
By: Andrew G. Blank  
ISBN: 9780782143709  
![Image of the book TCP/IP Foundations](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/tcp_ip_foundations.png?raw=true)  
Easy to read book for beginners who is interested in learning the basics of TCP/IP. The questions at the end of each chapter highlight the main points and offer a good review of each chapter.

Note that this version of the book is a bit old and focused on setting up Windows systems. This means that parts of the book are outdated with descriptions of how to setup older Windows versions that are now retired.  

## Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies  
By: Nick Bostrom  
ISBN: 9780198739838  
![Image of the book Superintelligence](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/superintelligence.png?raw=true)  
Philosophical book about what could happen when we create an artificial intelligence that is superior to humans intelligence. The author reasons that this could be dangerous and we might need to take precautions.  

## Agile Project Management with Scrum  
By: Ken Schwaber  
ISBN: 9780735619937  
![Image of the book Agile Project Management with Scrum](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/agile_project_management_with_scrum.png?raw=true)  
Scrum is a project management methodology for complex project such as team software development. The book serves as a fast and easy read for getting introduced to Scrum.  

I personally liked the check list about the scrum rules in appendix A. It summarized the methodology very well.  

## Make: Bluetooth  
By: Alasdair Allan, Don Coleman & Sandeep Mistry  
ISBN: 9781457187094  
![Image of the book Make Bluetooth](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/make_bluetooth.png?raw=true)  
Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) by showing how to build various projects based on popular maker hardware like for example Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Does not provide deep knowledge on BLE, but the book is adequate for anyone that looks for a quick introduction.  

Note that quite a bit of hardware is needed to finish all the projects, this will cost way more than the book itself.  

Lacks explanations for running the projects on Windows machines so look elsewhere if this is your preferred development environment.  

## Mine-Craft  
By: Daniel Goldberg, Linus Larsson  
ISBN: 9789113070247  
![Image of the book Mine-Craft](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/minecraft.png?raw=true)  
Nice book about development of the game Minecraft and the man behind the game i.e. Markus "Notch" Persson.   

This book is written in Swedish, I am not aware of an English version.  

## Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software  
By: Charles Petzold  
ISBN: 9780735611313  
![Image of the book Code](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/code.png?raw=true)  
Partly explanation of how computers work and partly computer history. The explanations of how computers work are done extremely thoroughly starting out with the very basics and then builds on until a complete computer have been introduced.  

This book is old by now, since it was released in year 2000, but it is still a formidable book well worth reading.   

## Six Thinking Hats  
By: Edward de Bono  
ISBN: 9780241257531  
![Image of the book Six Thinking Hats](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/six_thinking_hats.png?raw=true)  
Methodology for holding effective meetings.  

Most meetings at companies would surely be faster and more productive if they followed the pattern presented in this book.  

## Calm  
By: Dr. Arlene K. Unger  
ISBN: 9781845436391  
![Image of the book Calm](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/calm.png?raw=true)   
Mindfulness exercises that could possibly get your brain back on track if feeling stressed or having problem to sleep.

![Image of the book 100 Simple Things You Can do to Prevent Alzheimer's](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/one_hundred_simple_things.png?raw=true)   
Collection of tips on how to possibly stop or at least slow down dementia.  

Solid life-style advice's, that may or may not prevent Alzheimer's, but will for sure make you feel better and be more energetic if followed.  

## A Book of Abstract Algebra   
By: Charles C. Pinter    
ISBN: 9780486474175  
![Image of the book A Book of Abstract Algebra](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/a_book_of_abstract_algebra.png?raw=true)   
Rigorous text covering topics in abstract algebra. Plenty of exercises are included in the book.  

I did not have time to do many of the exercises and this probably prevented me from understanding most of the concepts in this book. Will hopefully read this book again sometime in the future and then learn more about abstract algebra.  

## From Mathematics to Generic Programming   
By: Alexander A. Stepanov, Daniel E. Rose      
ISBN: 9780321942043  
![Image of the book From Mathematics to Generic Programming](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/from_mathematics_to_generic_programming.png?raw=true)   
Discussions of generic programming based on principles from abstract algebra. Explains how to write effective and reusable code.  

This was the second time I read this book and I probably understood a little bit more than the first time. Will have to have at least one more go at the book to grasp everything.  

Good book for little more experienced software developers that want to take their craft to the next level.  

## 4 Timmars Arbetsvecka (The 4-Hour Workweek)  
By: Timothy Ferris    
ISBN(Swedish version): 9789186369835  
ISBN(English version): 9780307465351  
![Image of the book 4 Timmars Arbetsvecka](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/fyra_timmars_arbetsvecka.png?raw=true)   
Time management book claiming to teach how to work less and have time for other things.  

I personally did not really like this book. Some of the advice are kind of unethical. There are also some contradictions, like learn speed learning but don't read books because this is a waste of time.  

## Deep Work  
By: Cal Newport  
ISBN: 9780349411903    
![Image of the book Deep Work](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/deep_work.png?raw=true)   
 
Discussion about intense focus that enables solving demanding tasks. The task can be for example construction of mathematical proofs or designing complex software.

First part of the book discusses why being able to do deep work is rewarding such as for example becoming attractive at the job market. The second part of the book discusses organization of life style and working environment that makes it possible to do deep work.  

This is a very nice book and I agree with most of the points made in the book. If you want to attempt to make a mark in history try to live according to the advice in this book, if not just simply get back to Facebook again and make a post about what you had for breakfast.  

## Din Växande Värld  
By: Göran Rumenius and Jörgen Rundgren  
ISBN: 9789186951122  
![Image of Din växande värld](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/din_vaxande_varld.png?raw=true)   
 
Study technique book. Probably only available in Swedish.   

The book is kind of thin compared to the price. Should take most readers no more than 45 minutes to get through the 80 or so pages. So not really value for money.  

There is some alright advice. I for example liked the idea to start out by just skimming for the main ideas when starting to read a book. Maybe just reading the end chapter conclusions or looking for boxes with important material. Beginning with the integral parts gives maximum knowledge in minimum time. Then if there is time for more rounds so can the material that shall be learned be studied more thoroughly on each round.  

## Embedded C Coding Standard  
By: Michael Barr  
ISBN: 9781442164826  
![Image of the book Embedded C Coding Standard](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/embedded_c_coding_standard.png?raw=true)  
This is as the title says advice for how to write code in C.

It is important to use a consistent style in the entire code base for a project. This makes the code simpler to follow when reading other peoples code and can reduce the number of bugs.

This book presents generally valid guidelines that can be used as a base when setting up your own coding standard document.  

## Low Level C Programming for Designers: 2015    
By: Lars Bengtsson, Lennart Lindh, Mia Lindh   
ASIN: B015J5S50W    
![Image of the book Low Level C Programming for Designers: 2015](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/low_level_c_programming_for_designers.png?raw=true)  
Tutorial style book with close to the metal C projects to be run on a FPGA development kit.  

I have not been able buy the development kit (BeMicro Max 10) that is needed to run the project in this book. It also kind of seems that this kit wont come back, there is a newer but more expensive version in stock now. Not having access to the needed hardware unfortunately removes much of the value of the book.  

## Better Embedded System Software      
By: Philip J. Koopman  
ISBN: 9780984449002  
![Image of the book Better Embedded System Software](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/better_embedded_system_software.png?raw=true)  
Concrete advice on how to produce quality embedded software. The entire process from writing specifications to testing software is discussed.  

The book is easy to read and following the advice will surely improve the final result of your software development projects.  

Highly recommended read for both developers and software project leaders.  

## The Rook's Guide to C++        
By: Jeremy Hansen  
ISBN: 978-1304661050  
![Image of the book The Rook's Guide to C++](https://github.com/HenrikSamuelsson/books-read-2016/blob/master/Resources/Images/the_rooks_guide_to_c_plus_plus.png?raw=true)  
A small book on the C++ programming language written during a weekend by a group of students. Can be bought on paper or downloaded for free from [here](https://rooksguide.org/ "here").  

I plan to read a couple of C++ books to get better at programming in this language. This book suited me well as an appetizer for this quest.
